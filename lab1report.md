Many people usually fail in find the account because they cannot log into remote service. One tip is that your can test your account and your new password through LAB computer to ensure you already reset your account!

## 1. Installing VScode 

* vscode download: [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* If you took CSE11 Before, you can skip the vscode setup!
* I already finished installation during CSE11 so I skip this process.

## 2. Remotely Connecting

* use this code to log in: 
```
# replace xx with personal code! e.g. cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.ed 
ssh cs15lsp23xx@ieng6.ucsd.edu
```
* This message might appear on your computer if it is the first time you connect to this server.
```
# I recommand to select YES.
⤇ ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
```
* enter you password(same as reset password)
* If successful there will be information appear/if not you need to enter password again or wait until password successfully reset
* hint: you can log in you account in lab computer username:/password: to sure your password already reset!
* Dont worry about failure log in, once you can successful log in account though lab computer, you just need to wait a few minutes
